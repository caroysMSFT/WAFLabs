Injects the alert() javascript function into the page.

There's no specific rule for this exploit. There's many similar ones, but none look at the plain URI, they look at parameters. Their test exploit uses a script which executes on load to parse the URI and find executable code between certain delimiters.


So the best thing to do would be to create a custom rule which detects the alert function in the URI with some regex.

Very simple regex for detecting the alert() function in the URI:

alert[(].+[)]

Can we do better?  Yes.  We can create a custom rule to detect any functions in the URI (fix this shortly):

alert[(].+[)]
